## About KIARA

KIARA is a Discord chat bot that instead of using typical commands and prefix commands to perform tasks, it will utilise normal human language and perform the appropriate task.

The way KIARA decides which task it should perform is by performing text classification with the given request and behaves appropriately.

The main functions so far:
1. Reply to your sentence with a fixed reply.
2. Perform a google search based on your query.
3. Spit out a random fact.
